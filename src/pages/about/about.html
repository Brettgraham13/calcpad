            <h2>Canvas Rules</h2>
            <p>
                Our canvas is an arithmetic solver where input equations can be solved under the following conditions:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>The equation must contain numbers and/or fractions and at least one operator from the list below</li>
                <p>

                </p>
               
            </ul>
        </ion-slide>

            <h2>Basic Algebra</h2>
            <p>
                Draw mathematical expressions on the canvas, and press the equals button in order to calculate them.

            <h2>Equation Solver</h2>
            <p>
                The canvas can solve equations with one unknown, with the variable to be calculated written as a question mark. Scribble over an equation to clear it!

            <h2>Functions</h2>
            <p>
                A wide range of advanced calculation options are available, such as trigonometric functions and logarithms.

            <h2>Calculator Rules</h2>
            <p>
                A traditional calculator is also included in CalcPad, which has the following guidelines:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Invalid strings are not evaluated and will give an error message describing the error</li>
                <li>Numbers larger than 2^31 - 1 may be rounded and are accompanied by a warning message</li>
                <li>Numbers larger than 10^15 - 1 are expressed in scientific notation</li>
                <li>Exponents are denoted by putting two multiplication symbols in a row with the exponent wrapped in parentheses</li>
                <li>Missing parentheses at the end of a string are autofilled, and a confirmation message checks that the appropriate string was generated</li>
                <li>Strings larger than 15 characters are not handled</li>
            </ul>
